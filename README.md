## About
A growing collection of themes for qutebrowser. 

This repo was originally inspired by [dexpota/kitty-themes](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes) and [theova/base16-qutebrowser](https://github.com/theova/base16-qutebrowser). However, we will not require themes to comply with the [base16 guidelines](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/styling.md).


## Install

1. Clone this repo into your `.qutebrowser` directory:

   ```zsh

2. Set theme using at the _end_ of your `config.py` file:

3. Restart qutebrowser or reload your config with:
